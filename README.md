News
----
**09.15.14** - Development has resumed.

**05.26.14** - SongLyrics.com is now supported.

**05.20.14** - A functional version of lyricist now exists.

Supported sources:
-----------------
1. AZLyrics.com
2. SongLyrics.com

To be implemented:
---------------
1. Support for other common media players
2. Support for other sources of lyrics
3. Improvements to the way Lyricist searches for lyrics. If a title includes superfluous words such as "feat." lyricist may not find any lyrics. 

Known bugs:
-----------
- SongLyrics.com often gives a blank "page" of lyrics. This is in contrast with their "No Lyrics Found" page, which the program correctly handles. The program outputs a series of spaces. This bug will be further investigated.
